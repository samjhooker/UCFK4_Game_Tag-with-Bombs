How to play
=================================================================
Simple, use the navswitch to navigate around the map. To win, hit the other player
before they hit you. To make the game more challanging, each player will be given a bomb
every 6 seconds, this will be indicated by the blue LED. By pressing the navswitch button,
a bomb will be placed in the players previous position. Don’t hit a bomb, otherwise you instantly lose. Have Fun.
